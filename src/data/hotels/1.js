    'Nice and clean, but noisy',
    'The room was barely clean, gunge around the shower cubicle and\nmarks on the surfaces surrounding the sink. Air conditioning unit\nover and above one of the beds made it unusable. BREAKFAST a major\ndisappointment, 08: 30 NO BACON only herbed sausages and what seemed\nlike reconstituted scrambled eggs. There where staff, I saw them, I\nheard them and that was about it.',
